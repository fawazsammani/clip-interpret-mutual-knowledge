Please insert the class folders here. Each folder should contain a set of images of a class. If using ImageNet, place ImageNet validation set (`val` folder) here. It should be organized according to how PyTorch [ImageFolder](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder.html) expects. This is already achieved if you use [torchvision.datasets.ImageNet](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.ImageNet.html) to extract the dataset.
